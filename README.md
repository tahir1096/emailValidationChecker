Hi,
Email validation Checker will check that your email address is valid or not.
There are some rules for writing Email Address some of them are as follows:
**Use a Combination of Letters and Numbers:** Email addresses typically consist of a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and numbers. Avoid using special characters unless necessary (e.g., "." or "_").

**Start with a Unique Identifier:** Choose a unique identifier for your email address. This could be your name, a combination of your initials, or a word that is meaningful to you.

**Include an "@" Symbol: **The "@" symbol is essential in any email address as it separates the local part (before the "@") from the domain part (after the "@").

**Choose a Domain Name:** The domain name comes after the "@" symbol and typically represents the email service provider or the organization you're associated with (e.g., gmail.com, yahoo.com, yourcompany.com).

**Keep it Simple and Easy to Remember:** Opt for email addresses that are easy to remember and type. Complicated or overly long email addresses can be difficult to recall and prone to errors.

**Avoid Special Characters: **While some email providers allow certain special characters like ".", "-", or "_", it's generally safer to stick with alphanumeric characters to ensure compatibility across all platforms.
